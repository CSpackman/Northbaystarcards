At one time he had every major baseball card set from 1948-1975. We spent countless hours sorting cards and putting cards in plastic 9-pocket pages as much needed missing cards arrived in the mail. As I got older, we spent many weekends at local card shows and card shops looking for deals, cards of our favorite players (Willie Mays & Roberto Clemente) and ones to complete our sets. By the time I was in high school, I had amassed a sizeable collection of my own; and in 1990 as my dad approached early retirement, he fulfilled a lifelong dream by opening up the first of two baseball card stores in Petaluma, CA and Cotati, CA named NorthBay Star Cards. Between my dad\\u2019s collection, my collection and my brother\\u2019s collection we had our starting inventory; and together we successful grew the business. Both stores remained open until the early 2000\\u2019s when most collectors moved to eBay for their collecting needs. My father continued the business on eBay until his passing in 2016. I have never stopped collecting and in honor of my dad; and to keep the tradition alive, I have decided to re-launch NorthBay Star Cards online (northbaystarcards.com). Born and raised in Northern California, coupled with 40+ years of hobby experience has allowed me to build a tremendous network of collectors. My focus and expertise are in vintage (pre-1975) baseball, football and basketball cards, in addition to sports memorabilia.
